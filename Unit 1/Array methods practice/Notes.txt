Advanced array methods
 - manipulating data is highly important
 - master arrays and methods and rejex
 - pivotal for websties databaese and web appllications

Mastering arrays
    -Ternaries 
        - like a mini if statement
        - {conditional ? truepath : falsepath}
    Spread operator
        -(...) 
        -will iterate through and add all values from an array-like object
        -spreads the elements(methods and properties) of an array
    Mapping arrays
        -when you have an array with several items that you want to break down the best way is .map()
        - .map() is an array method that will go through each items and do a thing
        - .map() returns a whole new array when its finished
        -other methods such as forEach() do not create new arrays and instead just paste content for the existing array
    Anatomy of .map()
        -the first part of a map method is a variable name that will represent each item from your array
        - this variable name should be named as the singular or the array
            - people -> person
            - books -> book
        - next you can destructure your item if you like, this is not required but makes setup easier
            -const {name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet} = person;
        -lastly you need to return the object bck to the map
            -return {...person, shirtColor: 'tye-dye'}

    .forEach()
        -doesnt return a new array, every modification effects the origional array
        you have 3 values to work with: value(item), index(position), array(whole)
        - the last export for a forEach loop is undefined this really messes with return loops
        - instead you can have a condiitonal that acts depending on the values returned
        - if a list is missing variables they get the definition of undefined, you can deal witht hem by ->
                -counting occurences
                -breaking up the array into smaller arrays
                -printing out every name that starts with an A


    .filter()
        -filter is how you can remove certain items from yuor array
        it will go throuhj each item and comapre them to a conditional that you set up, true gets added and false doesnt
